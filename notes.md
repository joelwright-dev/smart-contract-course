# Best Practices
- Look at code samples
- Check the course repository if you have issues
- Take breaks
- Use collaborative tools:
    - Stack overflow
    - Discord
    - Reddit
    - GitHub discussion tab
- Connect with hackathons to grow your network

# Blockchain basics
- Decentralized currency
- Decentralized agreements (smart contracts)
    - A set of instructions executed decentrally without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary
- Blockchains are intentionally walled off from old systems which don't occur on the blockchain
    - We can use blockchain oracles to interact with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts
- Hybrid smart contracts
    - On-chain and off-chain agreements
    - Chainlink
- DAPPs are the combination of many smart contracts
- Smart contracts create unbreakable agreements and promises

# The purpose of smart contracts
- Anything that can be done with an agreement should be done with smart contracts
- You CANNOT break a promise made through smart contract
- Smart contracts:
    - Cannot be altered (immutable)
    - Automatically execute
    - Are transparent

# Other benefits of blockchain
- Smart contracts have their own value

# What have smart contracts been used for?
- DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
- DAOs (Groups completely governed by smart contracts on the blockchain)
- NFTs (Unique assets)
